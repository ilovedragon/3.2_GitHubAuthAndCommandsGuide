# GitHubAuthAndCommandsGuide
This repository explains the GitHub authentication methods and provides information on commonly used commands in GitHub.

## Assignment 3.2-introduction-to-git-ii
- You have learned on how to create new repository and create the changes on it. For the assignment, create new repository named with professional naming that you want.
- On the readme file, explain `what is GitHub Authentication and how what methods available to be implemented?`
- Update the Readme file to contain least 15 github commands and what are the usage of them?
- What are the 4 Github commands that you think you will use the most in the real project and why? Explain it on the readme file.
- Create your ReadMe.md file as professional and beautifull as possible. (https://dillinger.io/)
- Push the changes you made to your repository. with different commit.

## GitHub Authentication

GitHub Authentication is the process of verifying and confirming the identity of users accessing GitHub. It ensures that only authorized individuals can perform actions on GitHub repositories, such as pushing code, creating repositories, and interacting with GitHub's features.

## Available Authentication Methods
- Username and password ONLY
- Username and password with two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Personal access token
- SSH key

For detailed explanations and instructions on implementing these authentication methods, please refer to the GitHub documentation.

## Commonly Used GitHub Commands

Below are 15 commonly used GitHub commands and their usage:

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git clone`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
3. `git add`: Adds files or changes to the staging area.
4. `git commit`: Records changes to the repository with a commit message.
5. `git push`: Uploads local repository changes to a remote repository.
6. `git pull`: Retrieves and merges changes from a remote repository.
7. `git branch`: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
8. `git checkout`: Switches between branches or restores files from commits.
9. `git merge`: Combines changes from different branches.
10. `git log`: Displays commit history.
11. `git status`: Shows the status of the working directory.
12. `git remote`: Manages connections to remote repositories.
13. `git fetch`: Retrieves changes from a remote repository.
14. `git tag`: Creates, lists, or deletes tags for specific commits.
15. `git revert`: Reverts changes made in a previous commit.

Based on the learning, the four GitHub commands I would use most are:

1. `git clone`: Used to create a local copy of a remote repository, allowing collaboration and development.
2. `git branch`: Essential for managing branches, which facilitate parallel development and feature isolation.
3. `git pull`: Fetches and merges the latest changes from a remote repository, ensuring an up-to-date local version.
4. `git push`: Uploads local changes to a remote repository, making them accessible to other collaborators.
